/// the instantiate arguments:
/// (1) deps: DepsMut -> a utility type for communicating with the outer world
///     allows querying and updating the contract state, 
///     querying another contract state, 
///     gives access to an Api object for dealing with CW addresses
/// (2) env: Env -> an object representing the blockchains state when executing the message
///     the chain height and id, 
///     current timestamp, 
///     and the called contract address
/// (3) info: MessageInfo -> contains metainformation about the message which triggered an execution
///     an address that sends the message 
///     and chain native tokens sent with the message
/// (4) msg: Empty -> the message triggering execution itself
///     for now, it is the Empty type that represents {} JSON, 
///     but the type of this argument can be anything that is deserializable

/// -> there is no MessageInfo argument
///    queries can never depend on who sends the message 
///    or on any query circumstances besides the blockchain state itself
///    queries also never have funds sent with them
/// -> the returned type is not a Response, but a Binary type instead
///     it is because the query returns arbitrary data to the querier 
///     instead of processing a full actor flow which is handled with Response type
